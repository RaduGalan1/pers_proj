# 👨‍💻Projects

## *VOYAS -  Intelligent itinerary generator and travelling assistant* 🧳🤖

#### *Short description:* 
It uses a list of touristic objectives, a location, a time period. Takes into consideration: the user's interests, the active hours, recommended visit time, prefered transit, the need for uniformly distributed activities on all days, shortest route distance, and other personal information for a custom travelling itinerary.

#### *My contribution:*
 I constructed the idea and the plan based on a personal need. Designed and implemented multiple solution for this problem (or subproblems):

 - Research on dozen of different methods of solving this age-old problem
 - Solving as a greedy problem
 - Solving as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) using search and optimization algorithms
 - Solving as Scheduling Problem using agent-based modelling 
 - Solving as a Density-based clustering problem
 - Coordinating the team, architecture, design, business

#### *Team size:* 4-8 (varying across time)
#### *Development time:* ~2 years (2017- 2020)
#### *Context:* 
started as multiple personal school projects, pitched it, put a small team of friends together and participated in two startup incubators
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, scikitlearn, pytorch, multiple public api's, openstreetmap, multiple ML libraries
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- the problem has many names but the most popular ones are: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), OP (the orienteering problem), and the Scheduling Problem
- recommendation systems are usually underrated in complexity (we experimented with different algorithms) and we had many complication due to the current stigma

## *Autonomous driving vehicle* 🤖🚙 

#### *Short description:* 
We built a track of ~200 sq. meters. We developed software and engineered augmentations for a miniature car that would be able to self-drive in multiple scenarios. The car was able to independently lane keep in multiple road conditions, drive through intersections (with signs or semaphores), check for pedestrians on crossings and park.
#### *My contribution:*

 - designed the software architecture, implemented the image processing algorithms, integrated the SVM model, tested and developed the driving strategies
 - created and managed the team, made presentations, reports, demos, built track

## *Active learning for infrastructure recognition* 📷🚗🧠

#### *Short description:* 
The purpose was to identify infrastructure (particularly bridges and tunnels) on real-world automotive data. This was a production-ready project that ended up also being deployed. I labelled a driving dataset with tunnel,bridge classifications (binary and multi-class); trained and tuned multiple models on the data; applied data optimization methods (active and semi-supervised learning); and created a simple GUI for the whole process.  
#### *My contribution:* 
Almost complete personal contribution (I received help with industrial data collection and scientific research mentoring)
#### *Images:*

#### *Team size:* 1 
#### *Development time:* 10 months
#### *Context:* 
This was a project developed for Robert Bosch. At the same time it  was presented in multiple conferences (national and international) and represented a basis for my bachelor thesis. The name of the work is "AUTOMOTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS: TUNNEL RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES"
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, spark, keras computer vision, docker, py desktop GUI, big data, CNN models, active learning and semi-supervised learning 
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- data was plenty in this case which made cleaning and filtering a very important job
- active learning was an important component as I wanted to get the best performance with smallest ammount of data
- the project included a sophisticated custom created GUI for loading, training, validating models and loading, labelling, filtering data
