# 👨‍💻Projects

## *VOYAS -  Intelligent itinerary generator and travelling assistant* 🧳🤖

#### *Short description:* 
It uses a list of touristic objectives, a location, a time period. Takes into consideration: the user's interests, the active hours, recommended visit time, prefered transit, the need for uniformly distributed activities on all days, shortest route distance, and other personal information for a custom travelling itinerary.

#### *My contribution:*
 I constructed the idea and the plan based on a personal need. Designed and implemented multiple solution for this problem (or subproblems):

 - Research on dozen of different methods of solving this age-old problem
 - Solving as a greedy problem
 - Solving as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) using search and optimization algorithms
 - Solving as Scheduling Problem using agent-based modelling 
 - Solving as a Density-based clustering problem
 - Coordinating the team, architecture, design, business

#### *Team size:* 4-8 (varying across time)
#### *Development time:* ~2 years (2017- 2020)
#### *Context:* 
started as multiple personal school projects, pitched it, put a small team of friends together and participated in two startup incubators
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, scikitlearn, pytorch, multiple public api's, openstreetmap, multiple ML libraries
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- the problem has many names but the most popular ones are: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), OP (the orienteering problem), and the Scheduling Problem
- recommendation systems are usually underrated in complexity (we experimented with different algorithms) and we had many complication due to the current stigma

## *Autonomous driving vehicle* 🤖🚙 

#### *Short description:* 
on a track of ~200 sq. meters we developed and engineered augmentations for a miniature car that would be able to self-drive in multiple scenarios. The car was able to independently lane keep in multiple road conditions, drive through intersections (with signs or semaphores), check for pedestrians on crossings and park.

#### *Development time:* 10 months
#### *Context:* 
enrolled in a competition organised by Robert Bosch and participated all the way through semi-finals. 
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, sensory fusion, embedded, linux, robotics, electronics, SVM based sign detection, advanced image processings
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- the biggest challenge was that the entire system ran on a raspberry pi 4
- we had to construct a scalable and optimal architecture
- we used data from video, ultrasound, servo motor, gyroscopic motion sensor
