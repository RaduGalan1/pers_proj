##  **Anthropological agent-based simulation** 🐒🐒🤖🤖

#### *Short description:* 
The purpose was to create and simulate a population of early humans (Homo S. Sapiens) in the late Pleistocene of Europe (sometime between 40’000 - 12’000 years ago). The spatially explicit models provide accurate environmental attributes (temperature, altitude, geography, reconstructed ancient forests, and other resources) that are emulated based on a unique dataset inspired by satellite collections and scientific research. Human agents possess the abilities needed to perceive the environment, imagine scenarios, rationalize outcomes, decide what is best for them, and act upon the world or other agents. The decision-making processes are using decision trees trained on historical data extracted from the simulation world. All micro-level attributes and parameters are modelled based on anthropological, biological, geographical, botanical, and zoological statistical knowledge.

## *VOYAS -  Intelligent itinerary generator and travelling assistant* 🧳🤖

#### *Short description:* 
It uses a list of touristic objectives, a location, a time period. Takes into consideration: the user's interests, the active hours, recommended visit time, prefered transit, the need for uniformly distributed activities on all days, shortest route distance, and other personal information for a custom travelling itinerary. There is a personal recommender system, complex route optimization, location recommender, and live assistant.

#### *My contribution:*
 I constructed the idea and the plan based on a personal need. Designed and implemented multiple solution for this problem (or subproblems):

 - Research on dozen of different methods of solving this age-old problem
 - Solving as a greedy problem
 - Solving as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) using search and optimization algorithms
 - Solving as Scheduling Problem using agent-based modelling 
 - Solving as a Density-based clustering problem
 - Coordinating the team, architecture, design, business
 - worked on the location recommender

#### *Team size:* 4-8 (varying across time)
#### *Development time:* ~2 years (2017- 2020)
#### *Context:* 
started as multiple personal school projects, pitched it, put a small team of friends together and participated in two startup incubators
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, scikitlearn, pytorch, multiple public api's, openstreetmap, multiple ML libraries, nltk and other nlp libraries (intent recognition, sentiment analysis and multi-document summarization) 
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- the problem has many names but the most popular ones are: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), OP (the orienteering problem), and the Scheduling Problem
- recommendation systems are usually underrated in complexity (we experimented with different algorithms) and we had many complication due to the current stigma

## *Autonomous driving vehicle* 🧠🚙 

#### *Short description:* 
We built a track of ~200 sq. meters. We developed software and engineered augmentations for a miniature car that would be able to self-drive in multiple scenarios. The car was able to independently lane keep in multiple road conditions, drive through intersections (with signs or semaphores), check for pedestrians on crossings and park.
#### *My contribution:*

 - designed the software architecture, implemented the image processing algorithms, integrated the SVM model, tested and developed the driving strategies
 - created and managed the team, made presentations, reports, demos, built track

python, sensory fusion, embedded, linux, robotics, electronics, SVM based sign detection, advanced image processings
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- the biggest challenge was that the entire system ran on a raspberry pi 4
- we had to construct a scalable and optimal architecture
- we used sensor data from video, ultrasound, servo motor, gyroscopic motion

## *Active learning for infrastructure recognition* 📷🚗🧠

#### *Short description:* 
The purpose was to identify infrastructure (particularly bridges and tunnels) on real-world automotive data. This was a production-ready project that ended up also being deployed. I labelled a driving dataset with tunnel,bridge classifications (binary and multi-class); trained and tuned multiple models on the data; applied data optimization methods (active and semi-supervised learning); and created a simple GUI for the whole process.  
#### *My contribution:* 
Almost complete personal contribution (I received help with industrial data collection and scientific research mentoring)
#### *Images:*

#### *Team size:* 1 
#### *Development time:* 10 months
#### *Context:* 
This was a project developed for Robert Bosch. At the same time it  was presented in multiple conferences (national and international) and represented a basis for my bachelor thesis. The name of the work is "AUTOMOTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS: TUNNEL RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES"
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, spark, keras computer vision, docker, py desktop GUI, big data, CNN models, active learning and semi-supervised learning 
#### *Interesting facts:* 
- data was plenty in this case which made cleaning and filtering a very important job
- active learning was an important component as I wanted to get the best performance with smallest ammount of data
- the project included a sophisticated custom created GUI for loading, training, validating models and loading, labelling, filtering data

#### *Team size:* 1-3 (during its lifetime)
#### *Development time:* 5-7 months
#### *Context:* 
 Personal project that turned into an individual study of pattern matching and evolved into a university team project with a few other techniques and frameworks. 
#### *Technologies and tools:* 
python, yahoo finance, forex database, sklearn
#### *Interesting facts:* 
 - the algorithm achieved over 95% accuracy (with 5 classes of trends) in predicting a few of the forex currencies

## **Health and Diet assistant** 🥬🥕🥦🩹💤⛹️‍♂️

#### *Short description:* 
The first part of the project connects multiple databases to achieve a complete dietary bridge between health needs and food (dish name correlation to recipes and ingredients, food containing of different substances depending on state, adn substance correlation to medical effect). This was a search engine that looked through millions of data points to return recipes on custom queries. These could be customized to fit certain medical needs (from alergies to a blood sugar increase). 
The second part collects data from an intelligent watch (bpm, oxigen levels, stress, sleep, etc) which required integration with fitbit (IFTTT) along with hand-typed information from a form. Data is used to draw statistics and approximate trends in a simple GUI.
These two components could obviously be further connected.
