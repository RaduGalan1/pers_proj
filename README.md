# 👨‍💻Projects

## **VOYAS -  Intelligent itinerary generator and travelling assistant** 🧳🤖

**Short description:** It uses a list of touristic objectives, a location, a time period. Takes into consideration: the user's interests, the active hours and recommended visit time, the need for uniformly distributed activities on all days, shortest route distance, and many other information for a custom travelling experiences.

**Team size:** 4-8
**Development time:** 2 years
**Context:** started as a personal school project, pitched it, put a small team of friends together and participated in two startup incubators
**Technologies and tools:** python, scikitlearn, pytorch, multiple public api's, openstreetmap   
**Interesting facts:** 
- the problem has many names but the most popular ones are: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) ... 
- recommendation systems are usually underrated in complexity (we experimented with different algorithms) and we had many complication due to the current stigma

### **Autonomous driving vehicle** 🤖🚙 

**Short description:** on track of ~200 sq. meters we developed and engineered augmentations for a miniature car that would be able to self-drive in multiple scenarios. The car was able to independently lane keep in multiple road conditions, drive through intersections (with signs or semaphores), check for pedestrians on crossings and park.

**Team size:** 4-5
**Development time:** 10 months
**Context:** enrolled in a competition organised by Robert Bosch and participated all the way through semi-finals. 
**Technologies and tools:** python, sensory fusion, embedded, linux, robotics, electronics, SVM based sign detection, advanced image processings
**Interesting facts:** 
- the biggest challenge was that the entire system ran on a raspberry pi 4
- we had to construct a scalable and optimal architecture
- we used data from video, ultrasound, servo motor, gyroscopic motion sensor
